This repository contains the IBM Applied Data Science Capstone Falcon 9 project. The Falcon 9 rocket launches  advertised on the SpaceX website cost 62 million dollars. Rocket launches by other providers cost more than 165 million dollars each, much of the savings by SpaceX is because it can reuse the first stage of the rocket launch.

The aim of the project is to predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used by alternate companies to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The Falcon 9 data Data is collected using a restful API and the web scrapping method

* Interactive Visual Analaytics:Building a Dashboard to analyze FalconX launch records interactively using Plotly Dash and building an interactive map to analyze launch site proximity using Folium

* Predictive Analysis: Using machine learning methods to determine the successful landing of the first stage of FalconX. The ML methods include SVM, Classification Tree and Logistic Regression.

* Data-Driven Insights: Presenting the project findings and insights.
